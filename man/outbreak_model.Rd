\value{
A data.frame of cases by generation, with columns:
\itemize{
\item generation
\item case_id
\item case_type: one of "PEP", "HRC" (no PEP), "LRC".
\item infector: case_id of infector
\item new_cases: total new cases
\item new_cases_hrc: new cases that were high-risk contacts
\item new_cases_pep: new cases that were high-risk contacts that received PEP
\item new_cases_lrc: new cases that were low-risk contacts
\item n_hrc_pep: number of high-risk contacts that received PEP
